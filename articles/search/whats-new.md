# What's new in Azure AI Search

**Azure Cognitive Search is now Azure AI Search**. Learn about the latest updates to Azure AI Search functionality, docs, and samples.

> [!NOTE]
> Preview features are announced here, but we also maintain a [preview features list](search-api-preview.md) so you can find them in one place.

## June 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [Image search in the Azure portal](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md) | Feature | Search explorer now supports image search. In a vector index that has vectorized image content, you can drop images into Search Explorer to query for a match.

## May 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [Higher capacity and more vector quota at every tier (same billing rate)](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Infrastructure | Partition sizes are now even larger for Standard 2 (S2), Standard 3 (S3), and Standard 3 High Density (S3 HD) for all services created after April 3, 2024. If you create a new service now, you get the larger partitions. If you created a new service between April 3 and May 17, you get the larger partitions automatically. <br><br>Storage Optimized tiers (L1 and L2) also have more capacity. L1 and L2 customers must create a new service to benefit from the higher capacity. There's no in-place upgrade at this time. <br><br>Extra capacity is now available in [more regions](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#supported-regions-with-higher-storage-limits): Germany North​, Germany West Central​, South Africa North​, Switzerland West​, and Azure Government (Texas, Arizona, and Virginia).|
| [OneLake integration (preview)](search-how-to-index-onelake-files.md) | Feature | New indexer for OneLake files and OneLake shortcuts. If you use Microsoft Fabric and OneLake for data access to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google data sources, use this indexer to import external data into a search index. This indexer is available through the Azure portal, the [2024-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/data-sources/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true), and Azure SDK beta packages. |
| [Vector relevance](vector-search-how-to-query.md) <br>[hybrid query relevance](hybrid-search-how-to-query.md) | Feature | Four enhancements improve vector and hybrid search relevance. <br><br>First, you can now set thresholds on vector search results to exclude low-scoring results. <br><br>Second, changes in the query architecture apply scoring profiles at the end of the query pipeline for every query type. Document boosting is a common scoring profile, and it now works as expected on vector and hybrid queries.<br><br>Third, you can set `MaxTextRecallSize` and `countAndFacetMode` in hybrid queries to control the quantity of BM25-ranked search results that flow into the hybrid ranking model. <br><br>Fourth, for vector and hybrid search, you can weight a vector query to have boost or diminish its importance in a multiquery request. |
| [Binary vectors support](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types) | Feature | `Collection(Edm.Byte)` is a new supported data type. This data type opens up integration with the [Cohere v3 binary embedding models](https://cohere.com/blog/int8-binary-embeddings) and custom binary quantization. Narrow data types lower the cost of large vector datasets. See [Index binary data for vector search](vector-search-how-to-index-binary-data.md) for more information.| 
| [Azure AI Vision multimodal embeddings skill (preview)](cognitive-search-skill-vision-vectorize.md) | Skill | New skill that's bound to the [multimodal embeddings API of Azure AI Vision](../ai-services/computer-vision/concept-image-retrieval.md). You can generate embeddings for text or images during indexing. This skill is available through the Azure portal and the [2024-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true).|
| [Azure AI Vision vectorizer (preview)](vector-search-vectorizer-ai-services-vision.md) | Vectorizer | New vectorizer connects to an Azure AI Vision resource using the [multimodal embeddings API](../ai-services/computer-vision/concept-image-retrieval.md) to generate embeddings at query time. This vectorizer is available through the Azure portal and the [2024-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true). |
| [Azure AI Studio model catalog vectorizer (preview)](vector-search-vectorizer-azure-machine-learning-ai-studio-catalog.md) | Vectorizer | New vectorizer connects to an embedding model deployed from the [Azure AI Studio model catalog](../ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog.md). This vectorizer is available through the Azure portal and the [2024-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true). <br><br>[**How to implement integrated vectorization using models from Azure AI Studio**](vector-search-integrated-vectorization-ai-studio.md).|
| [AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill (preview) supports more models on Azure OpenAI](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md) | Skill | Now supports text-embedding-3-large and text-embedding-3-small, along with text-embedding-ada-002 from the previous update. New `dimensions` and `modelName` properties make it possible to specify the various embedding models on Azure OpenAI. Previously, the dimensions limits were fixed at 1,536 dimensions, applicable to text-embedding-ada-002 only. The updated skill is available through the Azure portal and the [2024-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2024-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true).|
| Azure portal updates | Portal | [Import and vectorize data wizard](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) now supports OneLake indexers as a data source. For embeddings, it also supports connections to Azure AI Vision multimodal, Azure AI Studio model catalog, and more embedding models on Azure OpenAI. <br><br>When adding a field to an index, you can choose a [binary data type](vector-search-how-to-index-binary-data.md). <br><br>[Search explorer](search-explorer.md) now defaults to 2024-05-01-preview and supports the new preview features for vector and hybrid queries.  |
| [2024-05-01-preview](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-05-01-preview) | API | New preview version of the Search REST APIs provides new skills and vectorizers, new binary data type, OneLake files indexer, and new query parameters for more relevant results. See [Upgrade REST APIs](search-api-migration.md) if you have existing code written against the 2023-07-01-preview and need to migrate to this version.|
| Azure SDK beta packages | API | Review the changelogs of the following Azure SDK beta packages for new feature support: [Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md), [Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Search.Documents_11.6.0-beta.4/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md), [Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md) |
| [Python code samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/readme.md)  | Samples | New end-to-end samples demonstrate [integration with Cohere Embed v3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/community-integration/cohere/azure-search-cohere-embed-v3-sample.ipynb), [integration with OneLake and cloud data platforms on Google and AWS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/e2e-demos/azure-ai-search-e2e-build-demo.ipynb), and [integration with Azure AI Vision multimodal APIs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/embeddings/multimodal-embeddings/multimodal-embeddings.ipynb). |
<!-- | Network security perimeter support (preview) | Feature | A network security perimeter is a new service that provides a secure perimeter for communication, and controlled access to resources outside of the perimeter. Azure AI Search is one of the eight Azure services that can run within a network security perimeter. This feature is provided by the [2024-03-01-preview Management REST API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/operation-groups?view=rest-searchmanagement-2024-03-01-preview&preserve-view=true) and the Azure portal. | -->

## April 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [Security update addressing information disclosure](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29063) | API | GET responses [no longer return connection strings or keys](search-api-migration.md#breaking-change-for-client-code-that-reads-connection-information). Applies to GET Skillset, GET Index, and GET Indexer. This change helps protect your Azure assets integrated with AI Search from unauthorized access. |
| [**More storage on Basic and Standard tiers**](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) | Infrastructure |  Basic now supports up to three partitions and three replicas. Basic and Standard (S1, S2, S3) tiers have significantly more storage per partition, at the same per-partition billing rate. Extra capacity is subject to [regional availability](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#supported-regions-with-higher-storage-limits) and applies to new search services created after April 3, 2024. Currently, there's no in-place upgrade, so you must create a new search service to get the extra storage. |
| [**More quota for vectors**](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#vector-limits-on-services-created-between-april-3-2024-and-may-17-2024) | Infrastructure | Vector quotas are also higher on new services created after April 3, 2024 in selected regions. |
| [**Vector quantization, narrow vector data types, and a new `stored` property (preview)**](vector-search-how-to-configure-compression-storage.md) | Feature | Collectively, these three features add vector compression and smarter storage options. First, *scalar quantization* reduces vector index size in memory and on disk. Second, [narrow data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types) reduce per-field storage by storing smaller values. Third, you can use `stored` to opt-out of storing the extra copy of a vector that's used only for search results. If you don't need vectors in a query response, you can set `stored` to false to save on space. |
| [**2024-03-01-preview Search REST API**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2024-03-01-preview) | API | New preview version of the Search REST APIs for the new data types, vector compression properties, and vector storage options. |
| [**2024-03-01-preview Management REST API**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/operation-groups?view=rest-searchmanagement-2024-03-01-preview&preserve-view=true) | API | New preview version of the Management REST APIs for control plane operations.  |
| [**2023-07-01-preview deprecation announcement**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-07-01-preview) | API | Deprecation announced on April 8, 2024. Retirement on July 8, 2024. This was the first REST API that offered vector search support. Newer API versions have a different vector configuration. We recommend [migrating to a newer version](search-api-migration.md) as soon as possible. |

## February 2024

| Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type |  Description |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| New dimension limits | Feature | For vector fields, maximum dimension limits are now `3072`, up from `2048`. |
